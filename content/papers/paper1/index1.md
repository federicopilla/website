##### Abstract

---
Married women’s labor force participation in the U.S. reached historic highs after the COVID-19
pandemic, despite declining real wages. I hypothesize that expansion of teleworking played a key
role in this shift. I provide a set of novel facts to support this view. First, the participation boom
of married women is driven by entry into teleworkable jobs. Second, married men in teleworkable
jobs sharply increased home-production time, while women’s home-work remained unchanged
and disproportionately high. Third, married women experienced a pronounced compression of
the wage distribution, largely driven by decreases in pay for teleworkable jobs and at the top, with
no comparable decline for men. Together, these patterns suggest a “flexibility trap”: teleworking
relaxes time constraints and raises female labor supply, but also intensifies downward wage
pressure when willingness-to-pay for flexibility is higher among women. I then develop and
calibrate a joint-search model of household labor supply with job amenities. A realistic rise in
teleworking availability accounts for the surge in married women’s labor supply and generates
higher equilibrium unemployment in the new steady state. The results highlight teleworking as a
central driver of post-pandemic female participation and a potential source of gender inequality.
