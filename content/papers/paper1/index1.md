##### Abstract

What are the effects of the rise of teleworking on the labor supply of married women in the United
States? I document that married women’s labor force participation reached historic highs after the
pandemic, despite flat real wages. I examine whether the rapid expansion of teleworking explains
this rise and how it reshaped within-household specialization and the wage distribution among
opposite-sex married couples. I document two additional facts: (i) married men in teleworkable
jobs increased their home-production time, while wives’ home time remained unchanged and
disproportionately high; and (ii) married women experienced a pronounced decline in wages at
the top of the distribution, where teleworkable occupations are concentrated, with no comparable
decline for men. These patterns point to a "flexibility trap": teleworking relaxes household time
constraints and increases married women’s labor supply, but also reinforces downward wage
pressures when willingness-to-pay for flexibility is higher among women. To interpret these
findings, I develop a model of heterogeneous households’ labor supply with joint search and
job amenities (teleworking), which raises effective home time for the employed. Calibrated to
match pre-pandemic labor market stocks and flows, the model shows that a realistic increase in
teleworking availability can account for the observed rise in married women’s labor supply. In
this new equlibrium, the model also reproduces a higher unemployment rate for married women,
suggesting that the shift towards teleworking may affect our interpretation of labor market slack.
